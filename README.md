Celeste Spring Collab 2020 Randomizer
==========================

This is a collection of randomizer configuration files and routing descriptions for the [Spring Collab 2020 pack](https://gamebanana.com/maps/211745) of maps for [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/). 

The config is designed to be compatible with the [Celeste Randomizer](https://github.com/rhelmot/CelesteRandomizer).

**Note**: For the best experience, it is recommended to play the Collab first before playing the randomizer add-on.
