Celeste Spring Collab 2020 Randomizer
==========================

This is a collection of randomizer configuration files and routing descriptions for the [Spring Collab 2020 pack](https://gamebanana.com/maps/211745) of maps for [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/). 

The config is designed to be compatible with the [Celeste Randomizer](https://github.com/rhelmot/CelesteRandomizer).

For the best experience, it is recommended to play the Collab first before playing the randomizer add-on.

Installation
------------
Running mods with Celeste requires you to have installed [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/).

1. Download the [Spring Collab 2020 pack](https://gamebanana.com/maps/211745).
2. Download the [Celeste Randomizer](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6848).
3. The config is included by default and the Collab levels will be available in the randomizer level select screen.

Difficulty Modes
----------------
The difficulties are intended to be equivalent to the vanilla randomizer difficulties, which are defined [here](https://github.com/rhelmot/CelesteRandomizer#difficulty-modes). The ratings are based on difficulty of execution and assume that you have played the Collab before. If you haven't, some screens may be harder than the ratings imply. The current difficulty ratings for each screen and other information on routing can be found in the documentation [here](docs/routing). If you find new routes or would like to suggest tweaks or changes to difficulty ratings, feel free to contact me!

Choosing a difficulty means any room can be included that is at that difficulty or lower. Here's a estimate of the pool size for each difficulty (all routes and dash numbers):
* Normal: 56% (56% total)
* Hard: 26% (82% total)
* Expert: 13% (95% total)
* Master: 3% (98% total)
* Perfect: 2% (100% total)


Known Issues / Planned Additions
--------------------------------
1. Intro/ending rooms that do not have gameplay in them were mostly removed to avoid a surplus of uninteresting rooms. If you think one should be added back in or one that was kept should be taken out, let me know.
2. There are not many reverse routes in the collab, which means Labyrinths may be hard or impossible to generate depending on your settings. If you run into this issue, include levels from other packs in your pool.
3. The blackout triggers (e.g. those in Rue's map and Cookie's advanced map) are currently not working with randomizer.
4. This config is recently released and may still have softlocks or misconfigurations.
